    description = ''Streaming of OptiTrack mocap data to tf
    <p>
    This package contains a node that translates motion capture data from an
    OptiTrack rig to tf transforms, poses and 2D poses. The node receives
    packets that are streamed by a NatNet compliant source, decodes them and
    broadcasts the poses of configured rigid bodies as tf transforms, poses,
    and/or 2D poses.
    </p>
    <p>
    Currently, this node supports the NatNet streaming protocol v3.0
