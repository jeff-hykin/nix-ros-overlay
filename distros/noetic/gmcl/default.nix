         gmcl, which stands for general monte carlo localization,
         is a probabilistic-based localization technique for mobile robots in
         2D-known map. It integrates the adaptive monte carlo localization
         - amcl - approach with three different particle filter algorithms (Optimal, Intelligent,
         Self-adaptive) to improve the performance while working in real time.

         Main node structure and amcl-algorithmsâ€™s code was derived, with thanks, from Brian Gerkey's amcl package.
